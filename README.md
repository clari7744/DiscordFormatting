# DiscordFormatting

A couple tutorials about the inner workings of Discord formatting.

### [DISCORD_MARKDOWN.md](DISCORD_MARKDOWN.md)

This page explains how Discord's special brand of Markdown works. Markdown is a way to use special characters for rich text formatting, but Discor works slightly different from the standard or GitHub's version.

### [MENTIONABLE_OBJECTS.md](MENTIONABLE_OBJECTS.md)

This page explains the inner workings of "mentionable objects". These are:

- [Users](MENTIONABLE_OBJECTS.md#Users)
- [Roles](MENTIONABLE_OBJECTS.md#Roles)
- [Channels](MENTIONABLE_OBJECTS.md#Channels)
- [Emojis](MENTIONABLE_OBJECTS.md#Emojis)

They all have a similar format, but each have some unique quirks that are detailed on that page.
